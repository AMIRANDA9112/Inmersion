# Immersion Project

## Introduction

We are in a new era, and the world requires new solutions for education, more connectivity, more interaction, and better attention by students. For that, we are innovating and using machine learning and facial detection to get teachers and orators or any who need interactivity online to do easily his/her work.

Immersion Project is a plugin extension for video-chat applications that helps you enhance your on-screen presentations through a set of augmented reality tools. With us, you can forget about using your mouse and keyboard, freeing your hands to increase your audience's attention.

# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

## To test in local

We recommend using a python 3.6 virtual environment, please look for your O.S how to create via virtualenv library.

Then, when you create your virtual environment, access the new folder, and execute: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AMIRANDA9112/Inmersion.git
$ cd Inmersion
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
With this last command, we install all packages and libraries that we are going to use to run the app.

Run the app using 
```
$ python3 app.py
```
Finally, open your browser and access 'http://localhost:5000/' to run the web app on your local server. Use only for **educational purposes**.

Make sure you have added a LICENSE file in your project folder. **Shortcut:** Click add new file in your root of your repo in GitHub > Set file name to LICENSE > GitHub shows LICENSE templates > Choose the one that best suits your project!

I personally add the name of the license and provide a link to it like below. -->
